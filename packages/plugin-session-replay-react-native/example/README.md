This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application
Once the dev server is ready, you'll see the following options

```
info Dev server ready

i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
d - open Dev Menu
r - reload app
```

^ Follow the above instructions to test your app in the platform of your choice

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. On the metro terminal, hit r to reload the app

## Modifying the SDK

1. Make changes to the SDK in the parent folder
2. Hit `r` on the metro terminal to restart the app

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
