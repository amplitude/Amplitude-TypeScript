### Making Changes

#### Setup locally

Getting setup is quick and easy. Follow the steps below to get your your dev environment up.

1. Fork GitHub repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Build packages

```
$ git clone <HTTPS_OR_GIT_URL>
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

This repo contains mutliple major versions of all packages. For contributions to version `1.x`, create a branch off `v1.x`. For contributions to the `2.x` (latest) version, create a branch off `main`. Refer to the table below for more infomation about the release status of each package.

|Package|Version|Status|Dev Branch|

#### Test your changes

Building quality software is one of our top priorities. We recommend getting your changes tested using manual and automated practices.

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn test
```

When writing commit message, follow [PR Commit Title Conventions](#PR-Commit-Title-Conventions) for the format. A git hook will also run to verify that the format is followed.

#### Open a PR

Once you are finished with your changes and feel good about the proposed changes, create a pull request. A team member will assist in getting them reviewed. We are excited to work with you on this.

For contributions to version `1.x`, open a pull request against `v1.x`. For contributions to the `2.x` (latest) version, open a pull request against `main`.

#### Merge

As soon as your changes are approved, a team member will merge your PR to main and will get published shortly after.

## Practices

### PR Commit Title Conventions

PR titles should follow [conventional commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps automate the release process.

#### Commit Types

- **Special Case**: Any commit with `BREAKING CHANGES` in the body: Creates major release
- `feat(<optional scope>)`: New features (minimum minor release)
- `fix(<optional scope>)`: Bug fixes (minimum patch release)
- `perf(<optional scope>)`: Performance improvement
- `docs(<optional scope>)`: Documentation updates
- `test(<optional scope>)`: Test updates
- `refactor(<optional scope>)`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style(<optional scope>)`: Code style changes (e.g. formatting, commas, semi-colons)
- `build(<optional scope>)`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g. Yarn, Npm)
- `ci(<optional scope>)`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore(<optional scope>)`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert(<optional scope>)`: Revert commit
