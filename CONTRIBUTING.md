## Practices

### PR Commit Title Conventions

PR titles should follow [conventional commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps automate the release process.

#### Commit Types

- **Special Case**: Any commit with `BREAKING CHANGES` in the body: Creates major release
- `feat(<optional scope>)`: New features (minimum minor release)
- `fix(<optional scope>)`: Bug fixes (minimum patch release)
- `perf(<optional scope>)`: Performance improvement
- `docs(<optional scope>)`: Documentation updates
- `test(<optional scope>)`: Test updates
- `refactor(<optional scope>)`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style(<optional scope>)`: Code style changes (e.g. formatting, commas, semi-colons)
- `build(<optional scope>)`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g. Yarn, Npm)
- `ci(<optional scope>)`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore(<optional scope>)`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert(<optional scope>)`: Revert commit
